# Lightweight Metal Engine (LME)

### Overview

LME is a Swift framework that allows game developers and graphics developers <br>
to write native Metal applications for apple platforms without needing to set <br>
up fancy development enviroments or face with devenv-related errors.
<br>
The main goal of this framework is allowing both noobs and veterans of graphics programming <br>
to build easily and fastly reliable high graphics applications, eventually even allowing to integrate <br>
the existing code with native one by getting direct access to Metal API objects.
